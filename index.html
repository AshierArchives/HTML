            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I'm Ashier, a 23-year-old IT student at Western Mindanao State University in Zamboanga City, and I'm truly passionate about technology and computers. Currently, I'm working towards my BSIT degree, and I'm always eager to broaden my horizons in various IT domains. I find great satisfaction in tackling coding challenges, and I place a high value on teamwork. Beyond my studies, I love to immerse myself in the rich culture and natural beauty of Zamboanga City. Looking ahead, my ultimate goal is to make meaningful contributions to the IT industry by creating innovative solutions to real-world problems.
